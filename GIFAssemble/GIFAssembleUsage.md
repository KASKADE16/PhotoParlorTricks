## [GIFAssemble](https://github.com/KASKADE16/PhotoParlorTricks/tree/main/GIFAssemble)

### What does it do?

it reassemble all pictures in a folder back to a gif picture.

I suggest you using this gadget for folders created by GifDismember,for these photos extracted from thee are already numbered in order.so as to making this rewind more viable.

the usage is quite easy compared to its gemini,just

```bash
python subfolder.py
```

this makes all folder,which are in the same folder as the .py runs.enter its process.
